  This app was developed as part of

  web dev bootcamp. We practised CRUD operations, full-text
  search and geolocation. We also implemented a social media sharing feature.

        On week 7, Le Wagon's students are grouped in teams of 4 and tasked with
        building a clone of Airbnb as a marketplace. We would be using Git and
        Github for the first time together as a team! Enter all the PRs and
        pulls from origin master 👩‍💻

        Our idea was to develop an app to promote movie screenings 🎬🍿in secret
        places. The goal was to allow users to search movie screenings by
        neighborhood, buy tickets to these movies and also create their own
        movie sessions. With the user stories in place, we moved on.

        Based on the user stories, we defined the data model. Next, we did some
        wireframing. We drew the components and mockups for the pages required
        to complete each user story. We also thought about the corresponding
        routes. Here, the challenge was to understand which routes would be
        nested and what would be the correct route to display both the
        sessions created by the users and the sessions purchased by them,
        all in one view. Once that was settled, we created our app and split
        tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I coded the controller actions and practised the CRUD operations. Users
        should be able to create, read, update and delete their own secret
        sessions.

        One of the app's features was to show the venues on a map 🗺, so we
        integrated with Mapbox to get geolocation! This took us some time to set
        up but ultimately we were able to show the search results on the map 📍
        You can check the result on the left 👈

      <p>
        We also used the pg_search gem to help us with querying the database when
        the users would type in locations to search for movies.

        To handle authentication we used the Devise gem and for authorization
        we used Pundit. I felt like Pundit is not the most intuitive gem to
        implement with all its policies and authorizations helpers 🙃 When users
        were logged in, they would be able to access their dashboard (👈),
        where they would find their upcoming movie sessions, the past venues
        they booked and also any movie sessions that they might have created.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the core features done, we implemented a social media share
        button that integrated with WhatsApp and Twitter to share the details
        about the movie sessions.

    We were able to get all this done under 1 week! It was incredible to achieve
    these results in just 5 days, Rails is really powerful 🤩 We deployed our app
    to Heroku, so you can check it out at
