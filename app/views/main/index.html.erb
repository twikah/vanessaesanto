    Hi there! My name is <strong>Vanessa</strong> and this my website

      It's great that you you're here 🙂

    <p>
      I'm a junior web developer, currently working with OutSystems reactive
      apps. I love
      <span><em>coding</em></span> 👩‍💻‍,
      <span><em>cats</em></span> 🐈 and
      <span><em>french croissants</em></span> 🥐.
      I've travelled around for some time and am now based in Lisbon.

      Take your time to look around, get to know me some more and
      check out what I'm doing. If you feel like it, say <%= link_to "hello",
      contact_path %>!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, and here's my <%= link_to "resumé", main_download_cv_url %>.
