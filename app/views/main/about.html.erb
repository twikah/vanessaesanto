  <h2>Early years</h2>

  <p>I was born in Portugal in 1989 not very far from Lisbon. I had a happy childhood, full of freedom and fun.</p>

  <h2>Moving out</h2>

  <p>At 18, I moved to Lisbon to get my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management, which I completed in 2010. I always aspired to become independent so as soon as I finished my degree I started looking for a job.</p>
  <p>I worked as a customer assistant in a bank - CGD, SA - for 6 years, most of that time also studying by night to get 2 more Post Graduates in Finance and Accounting.</p>

  <h2>Moving abroad</h2>

  <p>2016 was a big year. I wanted to travel and work abroad so I quit my reliable, stable job, got a VISA to Australia and off I went!</p>
  <p>My year in Australia was golden. I found a new job in a small medical recruiting company where I converted from being an office assistant to a junior developer when I volunteered to do a new website for the company!</p>

  <h2>Moving around</h2>

  <p>Since late 2017 I've been working remotely and travelling across the globe.</p>
  <p>I kept on learning how to code throughout the years and in 2020 I attended an intensive 9-week web dev bootcamp at Le Wagon to learn Ruby more in depth.</p>
  <p>I also became a certified OutSystems Web Developer and am currently working as an OutSystems Reactive Developer.</p>
