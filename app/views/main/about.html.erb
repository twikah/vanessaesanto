  <h2>Early years</h2>

  <p>I was born in Portugal in 1989 not very far from the country's capital, Lisbon. I had a happy childhood, full of freedom and fun.</p>

  <h2>Moving out</h2>

  <p>At 18, I moved to Lisbon to get my Bachelor's Degree in Business Management, which I completed in 2010. I always aspired to become independent so as soon as I finished my degree I started looking for a job.</p>
  <p>I worked as a customer assistant in a bank - CGD, SA - for 6 years, most of that time also studying by night to get 2 more Post Graduates in Finance and Accounting.</p>

  <h2>Moving abroad</h2>

  <p>2016 was a big year. I wanted to travel and work abroad so I quit my reliable, stable job, got a VISA to Australia and off I went!</p>
  <p>My year in Australia was golden. I found a new job in a small medical recruiting company. I started out as an office assistant, managing processes and accounting. Then, I found out that my boss wanted a new website for the company. Right there and then I saw the opportunity to start learning web development and volunteered to do it!</p>

  <h2>Moving around</h2>

  <p>Since late 2017 I've been working remotely and travelling across the globe, sharing this adventure with my <a href="https://ferreira.rocks" target="_blank">better half</a>. Since then, I've launched the company's new website and helped streamline processes by building a back-office for bookings management, automating as much as I could.</p>
  <p>In 2020 I attended an intensive 9-week web dev bootcamp at Le Wagon to learn Ruby more in depth. I'm currently looking for a position as a web developer in a challenging and creative environment within a team that encourages learning to develop innovative products.</p>
